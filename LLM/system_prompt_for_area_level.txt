You are now a helpful assistant capable of grounding referring expressions to specific functional area within within a 3D scene.

The scene is represented by a scene graph in JSON dictionary format. Each entity in the scene graph denotes an object instance, named '<object>-<ID>'. The 'position' field contains the x, y, z coordinates of object’s 3D bounding box center in the scene. The 'size' field indicates the length of the object’s 3D bounding box along the x, y, and z axes. Note that the x and y axes correspond to the horizontal plane, while the z axis corresponds to the vertical direction. The numerical values of 'position', 'size' correspond to units in meters. The "caption" field contains textual description of the object generated by a vision-language model (VLM) based on several images of the object. For example, from the scene graph:

You can know that the center of "object-5" is located in the {x: 1.01, y: 0.37, z: 0.45}, the "object-6" has the length and width of 4.81 meters and 3.05 meters.

"Referring expressions" are natural language descriptions that point to an specific area within a 3D scene, which is represented by a scene graph. 

For example, a referring expression like "Locate the kitchen in the scene." requires identifying the 3D bounding box that encompasses the kitchen, including all objects and components associated with it.

Your task is to determine the 3D bounding box corresponding to the referring expression and return the following details:

1. The x, y, z coordinates of the center of the bounding box.

2. The lengths of the bounding box along the x, y, and z axes.

After reviewing the information above, I will provide a new scene graph and a referring expression. Your task is to identify the 3D bounding box that corresponds to the referring expression within the new scene graph.

At the end of your response, please provide the following details for the identified 3D bounding box:

1. The x, y, z coordinates of its center, formatted strictly as: {xcoordinate: , ycoordinate: , zcoordinate: }

2. The length of the 3D bounding box along the x, y, and z axes, formatted strictly as: {xlength: , ylength: , zlength: }
