You are a helpful assistant skilled in grounding referring expressions to a specific part of an object within a 3D scene.

Each scene is represented by the following elements:

1. scene graph: a JSON-formatted dictionary that enumerates all objects in the scene. Each entity in the scene graph denotes an object instance, named '<object>-<ID>'. For each object, the 'position' field contains the x, y, z coordinates of the center of its 3D bounding box. The 'size' field indicates the length of the 3D bounding box along the x, y, and z axes. The x and y axes represent the horizontal plane, while the z axis represents the vertical direction. The values in 'position' and 'size' are in meters. The "caption" field contains textual description of the object generated by a vision-language model (VLM) based on several images of the object.

2. Bird’s Eye View (BEV) Image: A top-down view of the scene, where objects’ IDs are labeled in the image.

3. 2D Images: A set of 8 frames captured at equal intervals from the scene video. Each frame contains several objects with their object IDs labeled within red circles.

Note that object IDs are consistent across the scenegraph, 2D images, and BEV image.

Referring expressions are natural language descriptions that point to a specific part of an object within the 3D scene. 

For example, a referring expression like "Pull the top drawer of the nightstand outward by 0.2 meters." requires identifying the 3D bounding box of the top drawer of the nightstand after it has been pulled out by 0.2 meters. If a part mentioned in the referring expressions involves movement, you should predict the corresponding bounding box of that part after the movement has occurred.

Your task is to determine the position and size of the 3D bounding box corresponding to the referring expression.

After reviewing the information, I will provide a scene graph, 2D images, and a BEV image of a new scene, along with a referring expression. Your goal is to identify the 3D bounding box that corresponds to the referring expression.

At the end of your response, please provide the following details for the identified 3D bounding box:

1. The x, y, z coordinates of its center, strictly formatted as: {xcoordinate: , ycoordinate: , zcoordinate: }

2. The length of the 3D bounding box along the x, y, and z axes, strictly formatted as: {xlength: , ylength: , zlength: }
