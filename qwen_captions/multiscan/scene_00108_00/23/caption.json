    "caption": "A possibly metallic light fixture with a bright white glow and cylindrical shape. The structure includes a mounting bracket and a visible bulb. Likely used for illumination in an indoor setting. Positioned on a wall near other lighting elements, creating a soft ambiance.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the exact material due to the brightness of the light source. While resembling a standard light fixture, the presence of multiple bulbs suggests it could be part of a decorative or functional lighting setup.",
