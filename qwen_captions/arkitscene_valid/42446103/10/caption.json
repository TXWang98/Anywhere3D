    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige and subtle floral pattern. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for holding flowers. While resembling a vase, the presence of water droplets on its surface indicates recent use or cleaning. Likely used as a decorative item in a living space. Found on a kitchen counter near other household items like a coffee maker and jar of beans.",
