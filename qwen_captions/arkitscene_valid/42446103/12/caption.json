    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige color and a flared shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of subtle vertical grooves adds textural detail. Likely used as a centerpiece or ornamental piece. Found on a kitchen island surrounded by other floral arrangements and kitchen decor.",
