    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nHowever, upon analyzing the provided images, there is no clear depiction of an object within the green bounding box that matches this description. The bounding boxes seem to enclose areas of furniture and living room settings rather than specific objects. Therefore, a more accurate caption based on the given images would be:\n\n\"A [generic]-type object within the green bounding box. The area appears to include elements of a living room setting, such as couches and a coffee table. No distinct object can be confidently identified within the specified region across multiple viewpoints.\"",
