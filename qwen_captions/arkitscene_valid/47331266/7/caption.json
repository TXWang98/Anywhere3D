    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige color and a flared shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed to hold flowers or decorative items.

Found on the floor near a potted plant in a living room setting, surrounded by furniture like a sofa and coffee table.",
