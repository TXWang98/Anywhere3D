    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\nUpon analyzing the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints, it appears that the object is not consistently visible or identifiable. The bounding box seems to be placed over an area of the floor or a section of the kitchen without any distinct object present. Therefore, no specific category, attributes, or confidence signals can be accurately determined.\n\nOutput: \"An inconclusive area within the green bounding box. No distinct object is consistently visible across multiple viewpoints. Appears to be part of the floor or kitchen space without any identifiable features.\"",
