    "caption": "\"A glossy ceramic mug with deep blue coloring and rounded shape. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for comfortable drinking. Made for holding beverages, likely hot drinks. Sitting on a kitchen counter beside a coffee maker and jar of beans.\"\n\n\"A possibly glass vase-type object with translucent amber coloring. Fluted body shape and water droplets on surface. While resembling a vase, the presence of flowers inside confirms its use as a floral display container. Found on a windowsill with plants and pruning shears nearby.\"\n\n\"Inconclusive evidence for the exact category of this metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n\"A glossy ceramic mug with deep blue coloring and rounded shape.
