    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it could be a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\nUpon analyzing the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints, there is no consistent object within the specified area. The bounding box appears to enclose empty space or part of the wall and cabinetry in each image. Therefore, no specific object can be confidently identified or described.\n\nOutput: \"No identifiable object present within the green bounding box across the provided viewpoints.\"",
