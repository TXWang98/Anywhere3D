    "caption": "\"A metallic possibly tool-type object with a matte silver finish and angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it could be either a wrench or a specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe green bounding box appears to enclose an area that does not contain a single distinct object but rather part of the kitchen counter and appliances. The analysis provided is based on the assumption that there might be a small metallic tool-like object within this region, though it's not clearly visible. The surrounding context includes typical kitchen items like jars, containers, and appliances, which do not provide additional clues about the object in question. Therefore, the confidence level is low, and the description reflects uncertainty about the object's identity and function.",
