    "caption": "\"A possibly glass vase-type object with dark, reflective coloring and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of what appears to be a black cable inside introduces ambiguity about its function. Inconclusive evidence for its use as a purely decorative item. Found on a wooden table surrounded by various objects like boxes and tools in a workshop-like setting.\"",
