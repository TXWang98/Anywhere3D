    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige or off-white color and a slender, elongated shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative stems. While resembling a vase, the presence of no visible floral arrangement leaves its current function ambiguous. It is placed on a dark console table in a modern living room setting, near other decorative items like small white objects and framed artwork.\"",
