    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function between a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nHowever, upon analyzing the provided images, it appears that the green bounding box is highlighting a section of cabinetry rather than an object. Therefore, a more accurate caption would be:\n\n\"A white kitchen cabinet with smooth surfaces and rectangular shape. Features sleek handles and a clean design. Likely used for storage. Positioned along a tiled floor in a modern kitchen setting.\"",
