    "caption": "\"A ceramic possibly vase-type object with a green and white color pattern. The tapered rim suggests it may be used for holding flowers or as a decorative piece. It has a rounded, slightly flared shape with visible texture that appears glazed. While resembling a vase, the presence of nearby plants on the windowsill supports its use as a floral display container. Positioned on a small table near a window, surrounded by other potted plants and home decor items.\"",
