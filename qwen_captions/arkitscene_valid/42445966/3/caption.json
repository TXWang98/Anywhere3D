    "caption": "\"A transparent glass vase with a clear and smooth surface. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for holding flowers or decorative items. Its cylindrical shape with a slightly flared top allows for easy placement of stems. While resembling a vase, the presence of water droplets on its surface indicates recent use or cleaning. Found on a wooden coffee table in a living room setting, surrounded by holiday decorations and furniture.\"",
