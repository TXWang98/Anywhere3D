    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\nUpon analyzing the provided images and their green bounding boxes:\n\n1. **Image 1 & 3**: The green box appears to enclose an area of the floor, which does not contain any distinct object. It seems to be highlighting a section of the wooden flooring.\n\n2. **Image 2**: The green box is placed on a wall-mounted structure that looks like part of a ventilation system or a speaker. However, there's no clear object within the box itself.\n\n3. **Image 4 & 5**: Similar to Image 1 & 3, the green box highlights a portion of the floor without any discernible object.\n\nGiven these observations, none of the images show a clear object within the green bounding box. Therefore, generating a caption as per the template is not feasible. Instead, here\u2019s a descriptive note:\n\n\"No distinct object is present within the green bounding boxes across the provided images. The boxes seem to highlight sections of the floor and a wall-mounted structure, but no specific items are enclosed.\"",
