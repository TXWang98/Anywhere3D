    "caption": "\"A white possibly cabinet-type object with a rectangular shape. Smooth surface and simple design. Likely used for storage in a kitchen setting. Positioned adjacent to countertops and other cabinetry, with visible handles for access.\"\n\nConfidence signals:\n- The consistent rectangular shape across multiple viewpoints suggests it is a cabinet.\n- While resembling a cabinet, the presence of similar objects nearby reinforces its function as storage.\n- Inconclusive evidence for alternative uses given the context of the kitchen environment.",
