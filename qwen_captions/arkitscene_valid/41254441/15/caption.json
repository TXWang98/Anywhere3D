Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be used as a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop-like environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\nGiven the provided images, there is no visible object within the green bounding box that can be clearly identified. The bounding box appears to be empty or contains only part of the kitchen structure (like a wall or counter edge). Therefore, generating a detailed caption based on the specified template is not feasible.
