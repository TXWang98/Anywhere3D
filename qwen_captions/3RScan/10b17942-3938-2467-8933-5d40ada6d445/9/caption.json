Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be used as a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\n\"A possibly wooden {generic}-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it could be a small tray or shallow container. Its flat surface and lack of handles indicate it might be used for holding small items. Found on the floor near a door, with no other objects immediately surrounding it.\"",
