    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige color and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of what appears to be a small opening at the top could indicate an alternative function. Inconclusive evidence for its exact use. Found on a dark surface near a window with sunlight streaming in, surrounded by plants and other household items.\"",
