    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a white and light blue color pattern. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for holding flowers or decorative plants. It has a cylindrical shape with a slightly flared opening. While resembling a vase, the presence of a framed picture nearby hints at its use in a home decor setting.
