    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige or off-white color and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of what appears to be a lid or cover adds ambiguity to its function. Inconclusive evidence for its exact use. Found in an indoor setting, possibly on a shelf or table, with other objects like books or containers nearby.\"",
