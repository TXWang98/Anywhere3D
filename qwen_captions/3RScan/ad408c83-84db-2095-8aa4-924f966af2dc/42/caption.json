    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts and other tools.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Category**: The object appears to have a geometric shape with sharp edges and flat surfaces, suggesting it could be a tool. However, the lack of clear functional features makes it uncertain.\n- **Attributes**: The color is a muted metallic gray, likely indicating a metal material. The shape is angular with grooves, hinting at a mechanical purpose. There are no visible handles or openings that would clearly define its use.\n- **Confidence Signals**: \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact function\" reflects the uncertainty due to the absence of definitive features like a handle or specific design elements typical of known tools. The surrounding context of a workshop with other tools supports the possibility of it being a tool.",
