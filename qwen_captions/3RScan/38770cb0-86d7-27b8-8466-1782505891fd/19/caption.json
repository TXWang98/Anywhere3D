    "caption": "\"A possibly plastic or metallic {generic}-type object with a light gray color and elongated rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it could be part of a larger structure, potentially a trim or molding. Its flat surface and smooth texture indicate it may serve a functional role in construction or design. Positioned along the ceiling edge, it appears to be part of an architectural feature, adjacent to a wooden cabinet and mirrored surface.\"",
