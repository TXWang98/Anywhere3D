    "caption": "\"A possibly wooden container-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it might be designed for storage or carrying items. Its structure appears to have a lid or top section that could be removable. While resembling a box, the presence of what looks like a handle on one side hints at portability. Found on the floor near a table with various items such as books and tools, suggesting a workspace or living area.\"",
