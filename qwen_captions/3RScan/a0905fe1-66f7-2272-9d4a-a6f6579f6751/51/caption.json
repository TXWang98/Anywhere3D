    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light green color and cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of small holes at the top could indicate an alternative function like a candle holder or diffuser. Inconclusive evidence for its exact use. Positioned on a shelf above a table with a lamp, in what appears to be a home interior setting.\"",
