    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object with a matte silver finish and angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be used as a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop environment near assembly parts.\"\n\n---\n\nUpon analyzing the images provided:\n\n1. **Category**: The green bounding box appears to enclose a section of a cabinet or storage unit rather than a distinct object. It is not clear if there is an object within this area.\n\n2. **Attributes**:\n   - **Color patterns & material properties**: The surface appears white or light-colored, likely made of metal or plastic.\n   - **3D shape characteristics & structural features**: The structure has a rectangular shape with horizontal lines that suggest drawers or compartments.\n   - **Functional affordances**: The object seems designed for storage, given the presence of drawers.\n   - **Contextual placement & surrounding objects**: The object is situated in what looks like an office environment, surrounded by desks, computers, and other office furniture.\n\n3. **Confidence Signals**:\n   - \"The rectangular shape and horizontal lines suggest a storage unit.\"\n   - \"While resembling a cabinet, the lack of visible handles makes it unclear if it is actively used for storage.\"\n   - \"Inconclusive evidence for any specific object within the green bounding box.\"\n\nOutput:  \n\"A possibly metallic or plastic storage unit with a white color and rectangular shape. Horizontal lines suggest drawers or compartments. Likely used for storing office supplies. Located in an office setting among desks and computers.\"",
