    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a light beige color and cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of what appears to be dried floral arrangements inside supports this function. Inconclusive evidence for its material properties due to lighting conditions. Found in an indoor setting near other decorative items like a white pitcher and a woven basket.\"",
