    "caption": "\"A possibly ceramic container-type object with a white and translucent appearance. The tapered rim suggests it could be a small cup or vase. Its cylindrical shape is consistent with holding liquids or decorative purposes.

Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose, but it appears to be placed on the floor near the toilet.\"",
