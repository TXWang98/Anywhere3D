    "caption": "A wooden chair with a light brown finish and slatted backrest. The chair has a simple, sturdy structure with four legs. It appears designed for seating at a desk or table. Positioned in an office environment, surrounded by desks, computer equipment, and various items like bags and papers placed on its seat.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The consistent wood grain suggests it is likely made of solid wood.\"\n- \"While resembling a typical office chair, the presence of items on its seat indicates temporary use as a storage surface.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its specific ergonomic features from this viewpoint.\"",
