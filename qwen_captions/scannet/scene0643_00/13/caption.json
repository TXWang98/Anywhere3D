    "caption": "A glossy plastic possibly container-type object with a translucent appearance and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding small items or serving as a cup. While resembling a vase, the presence of pens inside indicates its use as a pen holder. Found on a desk surrounded by office supplies like a computer monitor, mouse, and other stationery items.",
