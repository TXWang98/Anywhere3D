    "caption": "A possibly ceramic container-type object with a white and red color pattern. The tapered rim suggests it might be a decorative item or a small vase. It has a smooth surface and appears to have a circular opening at the top. While resembling a vase, the presence of printed text on its side hints at potential functional use as a holder or display piece. Found on a shelf in an office environment, surrounded by papers, a computer setup, and other office supplies.",
