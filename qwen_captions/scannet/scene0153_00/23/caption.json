    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a translucent appearance and an irregular shape. The structure includes a small opening at the top and a wider base. It may be used for storing small items or as a cap for a larger container. Found in a bathroom setting, partially obscured by a curtain, near a bathtub faucet. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility.",
