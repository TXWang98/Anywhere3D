    "caption": "A possibly wooden shelf-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. Has multiple compartments and appears to be made of wood with a smooth texture. Likely used for storage or display purposes. Positioned against the wall near a door, with shoes and other items placed on it.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The presence of shoes and other items suggests it is used for storage.\"\n- \"While resembling a shelf, the lack of visible contents in some compartments makes its function somewhat ambiguous.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility from this angle.\"",
