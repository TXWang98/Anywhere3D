    "caption": "A possibly metallic column-type object with a white and silver color scheme. Rectangular in shape with smooth surfaces. The tapered rim suggests it might be part of a structural support. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function, but it appears to be a stationary element within the room. Positioned near office furniture like chairs and a desk, indicating an indoor workspace setting.",
