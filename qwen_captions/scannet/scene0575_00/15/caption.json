    "caption": "A possibly metallic door with a silver handle and rectangular shape. The door has a frosted glass panel allowing light to pass through but obscuring visibility. It appears to be an entrance or exit point for the room. Positioned adjacent to a wall with control panels and a trash bin nearby, suggesting it's part of an office or meeting space setup. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function beyond serving as a doorway.",
