    "caption": "A metallic possibly container-type object with a dark gray color and rectangular shape. The structure features multiple levels with open sides, suggesting it could be a shelving unit or storage rack. Its function appears to be for holding items, though the specific purpose is unclear. Positioned near a door in an office environment, surrounded by desks, chairs, and other office equipment. Inconclusive evidence for its exact use due to limited visible contents.",
