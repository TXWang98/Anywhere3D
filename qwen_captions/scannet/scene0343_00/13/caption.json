    "caption": "A possibly plastic storage-type object with translucent white coloring and rectangular shape. Features multiple horizontal compartments and a smooth surface texture. Likely used for organizing small items. Positioned on the floor near a wooden cart and metal shelving unit in what appears to be a workshop or utility room setting. Inconclusive evidence for specific contents within the compartments due to translucency.",
