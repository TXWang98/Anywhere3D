    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility and context. The object is partially obscured by the table leg and appears to be on a tiled floor, suggesting it might have been dropped or placed there temporarily.",
