    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a dark blue color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a lid or cover, suggesting it is designed for storage. While resembling a box, the presence of what looks like printed material on its surface hints at potential use for holding documents or small items. Found near a table with scattered puzzle pieces and another chair in a room that seems to be set up for leisure activities.",
