    "caption": "A possibly wooden wall panel with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be part of a larger structure. Its smooth surface and clean lines indicate a functional design element. Likely serves as an aesthetic or protective feature on the wall. Positioned adjacent to a small round table and upholstered chairs in what appears to be a lounge area.",
