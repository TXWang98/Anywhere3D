Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box appears to enclose a section of the floor and part of a door frame rather than an object. Therefore, no specific object can be identified within the bounding box across the provided viewpoints. The analysis cannot proceed as intended due to the absence of a discernible object.",
