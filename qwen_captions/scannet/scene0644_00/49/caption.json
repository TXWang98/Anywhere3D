    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nUpon analyzing the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints, it becomes clear that the object is not a tool but rather a computer tower. Here's the revised caption:\n\n\"A glossy black computer tower with a rectangular shape and smooth surface. Features ventilation grills and indicator lights. Serves as the central processing unit for desktop computers. Positioned under a desk alongside other office equipment like monitors and keyboards.\"",
