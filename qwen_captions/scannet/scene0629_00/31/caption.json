    "caption": "A possibly fabric-covered chair with dark coloring and a rectangular shape. The structure appears cushioned with a backrest and armrests. Likely used for seating. Seen in a living room environment near a side table with decorative items and a vase of flowers.\n\nThe tapered rim suggests it might be upholstered, but the reflection in the mirror provides inconclusive evidence for its exact material properties. While resembling a typical armchair, the presence of the bounding box indicates uncertainty about its specific design features.",
