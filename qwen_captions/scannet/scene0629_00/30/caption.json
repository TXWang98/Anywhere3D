    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. The tapered rim suggests it might be used for gripping or turning components. While resembling a tool, the presence of nearby equipment hints at its role in mechanical tasks. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited context.",
