    "caption": "A matte black possibly container-type object with a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it could be a trash bin or storage container. Its smooth surface and sturdy structure imply durability. Likely used for waste disposal or storage purposes. Positioned on the floor near a backpack, jacket, and another bin with a plastic liner, in what appears to be an indoor setting.",
