    "caption": "A metallic possibly vase-type object with silver coloring and a flared shape. The tapered rim suggests it could be used for decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of a wide base indicates stability. Likely intended for holding flowers or as an ornamental piece. Found on a small round table beside a brown leather armchair in a cozy indoor setting.",
