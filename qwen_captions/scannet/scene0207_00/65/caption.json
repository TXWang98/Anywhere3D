    "caption": "A possibly plastic bottle-type object with a dark blue color and cylindrical shape. Has a rectangular label and appears to have a pump dispenser. Likely used for dispensing liquid soap or shampoo. Positioned on the edge of a bathtub, near a striped towel and another similar bottle.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The rectangular label suggests it's a commercial product.\"\n- \"While resembling a soap dispenser, the presence of another similar bottle indicates they might be part of a set.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact function without clearer visual details.\"",
