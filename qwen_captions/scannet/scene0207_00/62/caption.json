    "caption": "A possibly plastic bottle-type object with dark blue coloring and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it's designed for pouring or dispensing liquid. Likely contains a personal care product like shampoo or body wash. Positioned on the wall of a bathtub, near a towel rack holding a striped towel. Inconclusive evidence for its exact contents due to lack of visible labels.",
