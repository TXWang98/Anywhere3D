    "caption": "A possibly fabric container-type object with a white and black pattern. Appears to have a flexible, cylindrical shape with an open top. Likely used for storage or laundry. Seen on the floor near a bed with green bedding and a red bag in the background.\n\nThe tapered rim suggests it could be a laundry hamper. While resembling a basket, the presence of soft material indicates it's not rigid. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose, but its placement near personal items implies everyday use.",
