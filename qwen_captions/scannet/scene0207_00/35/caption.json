    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a vibrant red color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a lid or top section, suggesting it could be used for storage. While resembling a laundry basket, the presence of what looks like clothes inside hints at its function as a clothing or linen holder. Found in a bedroom setting near a bed with green bedding and a white polka-dotted laundry hamper.",
