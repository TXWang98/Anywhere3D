    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a translucent appearance and an irregular shape. The structure includes a lid and seems to have compartments inside. It may be used for storing small items or food. Found on a cluttered desk near a laptop, monitor, and various other objects in what appears to be a home office setting. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the lack of clear functional features.",
