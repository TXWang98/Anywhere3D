    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box appears to be empty across all viewpoints, suggesting there might not be an object present within the specified area. Therefore, no specific category, attributes, or confidence signals can be accurately determined. The surrounding context includes a classroom setting with desks, chairs, and computers, but these do not provide additional clues about the object in question.",
