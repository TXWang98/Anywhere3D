    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nUpon analyzing the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints, it appears to enclose a section of the wall and part of the room's corner rather than a distinct object. The bounding box does not consistently highlight a specific item but instead captures an area that includes structural elements like walls and possibly a door frame.\n\nGiven this observation:\n\n\"A [material] possibly {generic}-type object with [inconclusive color] and [ambiguous shape]. [Inconclusive evidence for structure/texture details]. [Ambiguous functional affordances]. [Contextual placement suggests a section of the room's corner and walls].\"",
