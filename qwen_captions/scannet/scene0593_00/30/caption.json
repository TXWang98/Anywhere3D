Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\n\n\"A possibly metallic tool-type object with a matte silver finish and angular grooves. The tapered rim suggests it could be part of a larger mechanism. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may serve as a specialized clamp or wrench. Found in an indoor setting near a small white cabinet and a wooden door.\"",
