    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with green and brown coloring. Has a slender, tapered shape with visible foliage extending outward. Likely used for decorative purposes or as a plant holder. Positioned on a countertop near other household items like baskets and a trash bin.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The tapered rim suggests it could be a vase.\"\n- \"While resembling a vase, the presence of leaves indicates it might contain a plant.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact function due to limited context.\"",
