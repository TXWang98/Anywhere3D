    "caption": "A possibly plastic paper cutter with a light beige and black color scheme. Features a rectangular base with grid lines for measurement and a sharp, metallic cutting blade. Designed for precise paper trimming. Positioned on a dark surface near office supplies like scissors and papers. \n\nConfidence Signals:\n- The presence of the grid lines suggests it is used for measuring and cutting.\n- While resembling a standard paper cutter, the angle of the blade indicates its functionality.\n- Inconclusive evidence for the exact material due to image quality.",
