    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a dark brown color and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of similar objects in the surrounding shelves indicates it could be part of a set. Found on an upper shelf alongside other decorative items and storage boxes in a room setting.",
