    "caption": "A fabric curtain-type object with beige and layered structure. Features a draped design with soft folds. Likely used for window covering and light control. Positioned above a window, complementing the room's decor.\n\nThe tapered rim suggests it is part of a larger window treatment setup. While resembling a curtain, the presence of sheer panels underneath indicates a dual-layered design. Inconclusive evidence for its exact material, but it appears to be a lightweight fabric suitable for indoor use.",
