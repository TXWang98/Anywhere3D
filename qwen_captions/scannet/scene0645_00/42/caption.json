    "caption": "A possibly metallic lamp-type object with a dark finish and rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it could be a shade holder. Its structure appears solid, likely designed for mounting on a wall. While resembling a light fixture, the presence of no visible bulb or wiring makes its function inconclusive. Positioned above an armchair in a cozy living space, near a window with curtains.",
