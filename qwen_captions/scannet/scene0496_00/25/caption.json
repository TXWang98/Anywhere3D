    "caption": "A transparent glass window with a multi-pane design and rectangular shape. The structure features wooden frames and allows natural light to enter the room. Likely serves as a source of illumination and ventilation. Positioned on the wall, providing a view of the outside environment.\n\nInconclusive evidence for any additional attributes or functions beyond its primary role as a window. Contextually placed in an office setting with chairs and tables arranged nearby.",
