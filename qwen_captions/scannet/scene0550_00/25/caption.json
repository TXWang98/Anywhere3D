    "caption": "A polished marble wall with white and gray veining, featuring a smooth, flat surface. The texture is consistent with natural stone tiling. Likely serves as an aesthetic and durable interior finish. Positioned adjacent to a dark wooden door with a handle and informational poster.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the presence of any objects within the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints. The area appears to be part of a continuous wall surface without distinct features or items.",
