Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nUpon analyzing the images provided, it appears that there is no consistent object within the green bounding box across all viewpoints. The bounding box seems to be placed over empty space or parts of the table and chairs in various images. Therefore, a confident description of an object cannot be generated based on the given data. If the intention was to analyze a specific object, please ensure the bounding box is correctly placed over the object in question across all viewpoints.",
