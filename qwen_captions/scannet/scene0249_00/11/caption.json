    "caption": "A possibly plastic chair with a light gray seat and backrest. The chair has a simple, utilitarian design with armrests and metal legs. Likely intended for seating in an office or meeting room environment. Positioned near other similar chairs around a long table, suggesting a conference or classroom setting.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the material due to image quality, but the structure suggests it is designed for comfortable seating in a professional context.",
