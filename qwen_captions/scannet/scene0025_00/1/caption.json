    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a white and translucent appearance. The tapered rim suggests it might be a cup or small pitcher. It has a smooth, rounded body shape with no visible handle. Its function is unclear but could be for holding liquids or small items. Found on a cluttered desk alongside various office supplies like bottles, papers, and electronic devices.",
