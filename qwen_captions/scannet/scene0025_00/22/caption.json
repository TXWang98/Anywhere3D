    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nUpon analyzing the green bounding box across multiple viewpoints, it appears that the object is not consistently visible or identifiable. The bounding box seems to be placed over areas that do not contain a single distinct object but rather encompasses various elements of the office environment such as desks, computers, and other office supplies. Therefore, it's inconclusive to determine a specific category, attributes, or confidence level for an object within the green bounding box based on the provided images.",
