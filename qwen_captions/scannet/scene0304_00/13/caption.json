    "caption": "A metallic possibly mailbox-type object with silver coloring and rectangular shape. Features multiple small compartments arranged in a grid pattern. Likely used for individual mail storage. Located on a wall in a tiled room, adjacent to similar units.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the exact function of each compartment, but their uniform arrangement suggests organized distribution. The surrounding environment appears to be a communal area designed for postal services.",
