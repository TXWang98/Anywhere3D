    "caption": "A matte wooden door with a dark brown finish and rectangular shape. Features a metallic handle and lock mechanism. Serves as an entrance or exit point. Positioned within a wall frame, adjacent to a light switch.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the material properties due to image quality. While resembling a standard interior door, the presence of a small device mounted above suggests additional functionality, possibly related to security or access control. Contextually placed in what appears to be a residential or office setting.",
