    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a woven texture, suggesting it might be a basket or bin. Its function is likely for storage or carrying items. It is placed on top of a stack of various objects in what seems to be a cluttered storage area, surrounded by boxes and other miscellaneous items. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the surrounding disarray.",
