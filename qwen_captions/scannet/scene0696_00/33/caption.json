    "caption": "A possibly wooden container-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a flat top and vertical sides, suggesting it could be used for storage or organization. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function due to the lack of visible handles or openings. Found on a cluttered surface near other household items in what seems to be a multi-purpose room.",
