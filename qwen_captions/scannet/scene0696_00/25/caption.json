    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box does not contain a specific object but rather encompasses an area of the room. Therefore, no specific category can be assigned. The description provided is based on the assumption that there might be a tool-type object within the scene, which cannot be confirmed due to the lack of clear visual evidence.",
