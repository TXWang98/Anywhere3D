    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box appears to enclose a section of the room rather than a specific object. The analysis above is based on the assumption that there might be an object within the bounding box that isn't clearly visible. Given the images provided, the bounding box seems to highlight a portion of the wall and floor area, which doesn't contain any distinct objects. Therefore, no specific category, attributes, or confidence signals can be accurately determined for an object within the bounding box.",
