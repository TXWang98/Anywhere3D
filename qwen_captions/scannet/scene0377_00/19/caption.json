    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. The tapered rim suggests it could be a part of a larger mechanism. While resembling a component, the presence of nearby tools and equipment indicates its use in assembly tasks. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility.",
