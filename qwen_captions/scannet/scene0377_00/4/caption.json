    "caption": "A possibly wooden container-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a flat top surface and vertical sides, suggesting it could be used for storage or as a platform. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function due to the lack of visible handles or compartments. Positioned on a countertop in what seems to be a kitchen setting, near other items like a cutting board and a white bowl.",
