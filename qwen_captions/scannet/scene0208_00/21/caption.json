    "caption": "A possibly cardboard box-type object with muted brown coloring and rectangular shape. Appears to have a slightly open top and smooth surface texture. Likely used for storage or transport of items. Positioned on a shelf amidst various books and other boxed items in what seems to be a bookstore or library setting.
