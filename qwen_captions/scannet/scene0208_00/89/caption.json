    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a white and translucent appearance. The shape is rectangular with rounded edges, and it appears to have a lid or cover. While resembling a storage box, the presence of items inside suggests it may be used for organizing small objects. Found on top of a bookshelf in a library setting, surrounded by books and other miscellaneous items. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it likely serves as a utility container within the library environment.",
