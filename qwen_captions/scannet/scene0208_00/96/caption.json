    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the blurred image and lack of clear structural details. The object is placed on a surface that appears to be part of a workbench, surrounded by other tools and materials.",
