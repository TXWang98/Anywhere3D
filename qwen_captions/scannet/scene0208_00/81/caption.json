    "caption": "A possibly cardboard container-type object with a light brown color and rectangular shape. Appears to have a slightly open top and smooth surface texture. Likely used for storage or display purposes. Positioned on a shelf amidst various books in what seems to be a library or bookstore setting. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function due to the lack of visible contents or labels.",
