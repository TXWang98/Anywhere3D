    "caption": "A possibly paper container-type object with white coloring and rectangular shape. Appears to have a smooth texture and folded edges. Likely used for holding small items or as packaging. Positioned on a shelf among various books and stationery items in what seems to be a bookstore setting. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the lack of visible contents or labels.",
