    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a white and translucent appearance. The tapered rim suggests it may be a cup or small vase. Its cylindrical shape is consistent with containers designed for holding liquids or small items. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it could serve as a drinking vessel or decorative piece. Found in a room setting near a chair with a bag on it and a closed door in the background.",
