    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility and context. The object is positioned against a wall, adjacent to a whiteboard and some chairs, suggesting it might be part of a larger setup or storage area.",
