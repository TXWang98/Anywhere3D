    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with green and white coloring. Cylindrical shape with a slightly tapered rim suggests it could be a bottle or jar. The structure appears smooth with no visible handle or lid. Likely used for storing small items or as a decorative piece. Found on a cluttered shelf alongside various personal care products, books, and electronic devices in what seems to be a home office setting.",
