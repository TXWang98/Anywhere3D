    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light blue and white color scheme. The shape is rectangular with rounded edges, and it appears to have a lid or top section. It may be used for storing small items or as a decorative box. Positioned on a wooden surface alongside other household objects like books and electronic devices. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the lack of visible contents or labels.",
