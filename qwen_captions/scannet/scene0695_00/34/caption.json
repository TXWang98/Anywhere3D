    "caption": "A cardboard box with a light brown color and rectangular shape. The surface appears slightly worn, with visible creases and folds. Likely used for storage or transport. Positioned on the floor against a wall, partially covered by a yellow fabric, with various items scattered around, including clothes and other objects.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The rectangular shape and material suggest it is a storage container.\"\n- \"While resembling a typical box, the presence of the fabric indicates it might be in use for temporary storage.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its specific contents due to the covering fabric.\"",
