    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box does not clearly enclose a specific object but rather seems to be marking an area of the wall and floor junction. Given the lack of a distinct object within the bounding box across multiple viewpoints, it is inconclusive to determine a category, attributes, or context. Therefore, no specific caption can be generated based on the provided images and bounding box.",
