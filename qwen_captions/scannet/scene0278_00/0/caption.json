    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function between a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop-like environment near assembly parts and a printer. The object is partially obscured by the wall corner, making detailed analysis challenging. Positioned adjacent to a counter with papers and cables, suggesting a workspace setting.",
