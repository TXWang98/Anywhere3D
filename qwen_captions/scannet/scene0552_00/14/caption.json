    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light gray color and rectangular shape. The tapered rim suggests it might be designed for stacking or storage. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function, but it appears to be part of a larger setup involving other containers and equipment. Found under a desk in what seems to be an office or workspace environment, near a green bucket and a stack of white items.",
