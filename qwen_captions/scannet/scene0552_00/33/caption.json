    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with white and translucent coloring. Cylindrical shape with a slightly tapered rim suggests it could be a cup or small bucket. The smooth texture indicates a utilitarian design. Likely used for storage or as a disposable container. Found on the floor near a green bucket and a cardboard box in an office setting with desks and chairs around.",
