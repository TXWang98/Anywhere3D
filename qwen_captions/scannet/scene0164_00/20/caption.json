    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it may be a wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in a workshop-like environment near assembly parts and a refrigerator. The object is positioned on the floor, partially obscured by the refrigerator's base, suggesting it might have been placed there temporarily.",
