    "caption": "A possibly glass container-type object with a translucent appearance and cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for pouring or serving liquids. While resembling a vase, the presence of a label indicates it might have been repurposed from a commercial product. Inconclusive evidence for its current function. Found on a kitchen countertop near a sink, dish soap, and other kitchen items.",
