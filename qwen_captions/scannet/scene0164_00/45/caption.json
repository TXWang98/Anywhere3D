    "caption": "A possibly ceramic container-type object with a dark and light color pattern. The tapered rim suggests it might be a decorative or functional vessel. Its cylindrical shape has a smooth texture. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function, but it could be used for storage or as a display item. Found on a kitchen countertop near a coffee maker and other kitchen appliances.",
