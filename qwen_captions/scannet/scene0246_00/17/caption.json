    "caption": "A possibly metallic wardrobe with a neutral beige finish and rectangular shape. The smooth surface and tall, narrow structure suggest it is designed for storing clothes. Its placement in the bedroom, adjacent to a bed and dresser, reinforces its role as a storage unit. While resembling a standard wardrobe, the presence of sliding doors indicates a modern design. Inconclusive evidence for additional features like internal compartments or shelving.",
