    "caption": "A possibly fabric container-type object with red and white coloring. Appears cylindrical with a slightly tapered shape. The texture suggests soft material, likely for storage or carrying items. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function, but it could be used for holding small objects. Found on a table alongside books and papers in what seems to be a study or office setting.",
