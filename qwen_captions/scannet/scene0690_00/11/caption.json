    "caption": "A glossy ceramic vase with dark blue coloring and a flared shape. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for holding flowers or decorative arrangements. While resembling a vase, the presence of a lampshade on top indicates it may also serve as a lamp base. Found on an end table in a living room setting, surrounded by leather furniture and patterned carpeting.",
