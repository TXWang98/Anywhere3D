    "caption": "A glossy ceramic vase with dark blue coloring and a flared shape. The tapered rim suggests it is designed for holding flowers or decorative purposes. While resembling a vase, the presence of a lampshade on top indicates it may also serve as a base for a table lamp. Found in a cozy living room setting, positioned between two leather armchairs and near a bookshelf.",
