    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited visibility and context. The object is partially obscured and located on the floor beside a chair, making it challenging to determine its full structure and intended use.",
