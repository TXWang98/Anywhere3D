    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a translucent white appearance and an irregular shape. The structure appears to have a smooth texture with no distinct features. Inconclusive evidence for its function, but it may be used for storage or as a decorative item. Found on top of a wooden bookshelf filled with books in what seems to be a library or study room setting.",
