    "caption": "A possibly framed picture-type object with a white border and rectangular shape. The image within appears to be dark, suggesting it might contain a photograph or artwork. While resembling a decorative item, the presence of a metallic hinge on the side indicates it could also be part of a door or panel. Inconclusive evidence for its exact function. Positioned above a wooden bookshelf filled with books, in what seems to be a study or library setting.",
