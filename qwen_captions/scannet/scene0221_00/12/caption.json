    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light beige color and rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a flat top surface and vertical sides, suggesting it could be used for storage or as a base for other items. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function due to the lack of visible handles or openings. Seen on a countertop in what appears to be a kitchen area, surrounded by various household items like boxes and appliances.",
