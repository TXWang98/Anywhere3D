    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with green coloring and a cylindrical shape. The structure appears to have a smooth texture and a slightly tapered form. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function, but it may be used for storage or as a decorative item. Found on the floor near a bed in a bedroom setting, with other furniture like a dresser and television visible in the background.",
