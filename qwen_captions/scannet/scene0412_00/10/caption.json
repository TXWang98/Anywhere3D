    "caption": "A metallic possibly tool-type object with a matte silver finish and angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. The tapered rim suggests it may be part of a larger machinery. While resembling a component, the presence of nearby tools indicates its use in mechanical tasks. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to limited context.",
