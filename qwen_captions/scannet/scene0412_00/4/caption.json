    "caption": "A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts. The tapered rim suggests it may be part of a larger mechanism. While resembling a handle, the presence of additional components indicates a complex structure. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose. Located under a workbench alongside other tools and equipment.",
