    "caption": "A possibly wooden board-type object with a brown color and rectangular shape. Shows signs of wear and scratches on its surface. Likely used as a protective or functional panel. Positioned vertically against a counter in what appears to be a kitchen or workshop setting, near appliances and tools. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose, but it may serve as a barrier or support structure.",
