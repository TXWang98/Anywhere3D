    "caption": "A translucent plastic container-type object with green tinting and a cylindrical shape. Contains various small items, including what appears to be a purple object and white fragments. Likely used for storage or as a temporary receptacle. Positioned on the floor near a wooden dresser, with books and shoes stacked on top of the dresser. The tapered rim suggests it could be repurposed from a food container.",
