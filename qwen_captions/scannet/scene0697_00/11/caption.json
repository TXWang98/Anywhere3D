    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with translucent green coloring. The tapered rim suggests it may be a cup or small bin. Its cylindrical shape and smooth texture are visible. Inconclusive evidence for its function, but it could be used for storage or as a disposable cup. Found on the floor near a wooden dresser with clothes scattered around.",
