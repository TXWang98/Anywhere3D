    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with white and translucent coloring. Rectangular shape with a slightly tapered form. The structure appears to have a smooth texture with no visible handles or lids. Inconclusive evidence for its function, but it may be used for storage. Found on a surface near other items like a bottle and what seems to be a book or magazine.",
