    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with black coloring and a rectangular shape. The structure appears to have multiple compartments or sections, suggesting it could be used for organizing small items. While resembling a storage box, the presence of what looks like rolled-up items inside hints at its function as a holder for documents or accessories. Found on top of a stack of books and other objects on a wooden dresser in a room setting.",
