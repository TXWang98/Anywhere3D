    "caption": "A metallic possibly container-type object with a neutral gray color and rectangular shape. The flat surface and lack of visible handles suggest it's not designed for direct interaction. Its placement on the wall near a toilet paper dispenser and grab bar indicates it might be a utility or storage unit in a bathroom setting. Inconclusive evidence for its specific function, but it appears to be part of the restroom infrastructure.",
