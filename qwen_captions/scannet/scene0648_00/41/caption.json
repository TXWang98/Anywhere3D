    "caption": "A glossy ceramic lamp with white coloring and a conical shape. Has a smooth, curved design and a black stand. Likely used for ambient lighting. Positioned near a window with blinds in a living room setting.\n\nInconclusive evidence for the exact material due to image quality, but the reflective surface suggests a polished finish. The tapered rim suggests it is designed to direct light downwards. While resembling a decorative piece, the presence of a visible power cord indicates its functional purpose as a light source. Contextually placed next to a window, possibly to enhance natural light during darker hours.",
