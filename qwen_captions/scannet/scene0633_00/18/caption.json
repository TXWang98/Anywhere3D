    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light beige color and cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it may be designed for stacking or nesting. Its smooth surface lacks distinct structural features, making its function inconclusive, though it could be used for storage. Found on a shelf within a nursery setting, alongside other similar containers and baby-related items.",
