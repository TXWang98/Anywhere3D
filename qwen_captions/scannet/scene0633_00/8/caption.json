    "caption": "A fabric curtain with beige coloring and a soft, textured appearance. The material drapes vertically, creating folds and shadows. Likely used for light control and privacy in the room. Positioned beside a window with a sheer white panel underneath, near a cozy armchair with cushions.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The vertical folds suggest it is designed to be drawn open or closed.\"\n- \"While resembling a standard curtain, the presence of the sheer panel indicates a layered approach to window treatment.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact length, but it appears to extend fully from the top of the window.\"",
