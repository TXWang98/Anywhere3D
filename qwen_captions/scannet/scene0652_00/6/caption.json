    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a translucent pink hue and a rectangular shape. The structure appears to have a lid or cover, suggesting it is designed for storage. Its function seems to be for holding small items, given its size and placement on top of a dresser. Situated in a bedroom setting, near other personal belongings like books and decorative items. Inconclusive evidence for its exact purpose due to the limited view and lack of clear identifying features.",
