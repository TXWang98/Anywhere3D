    "caption": "A white towel with a rectangular shape. Appears neatly folded and placed on the edge of the bathtub. Likely used for drying or as a decorative element. Positioned between the toilet and the shower curtain in a bathroom setting.\n\nAnalysis across multiple viewpoints confirms the object's consistent appearance as a folded towel, maintaining its rectangular form and placement relative to surrounding fixtures like the toilet and bathtub. The lighting and shadows suggest a soft, absorbent material typical of towels. No structural features indicate an alternative function. Contextually, it is situated in a standard bathroom arrangement.",
