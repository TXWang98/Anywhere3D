    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box does not contain a distinct object but rather outlines a section of the wall and floor. Therefore, no specific category or attributes can be confidently assigned. The context suggests a bathroom setting with a bathtub and tiled flooring.",
