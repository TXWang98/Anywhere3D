    "caption": "A metallic possibly table-type object with a white top and cylindrical shape. Has a single central leg and a circular base. Likely used for seating or as a small dining surface. Positioned near orange stools in a recreational area with a ping pong table and wall decorations.\n\nConfidence Signals:\n- \"The cylindrical leg suggests it is designed for stability.\"\n- \"While resembling a table, the presence of nearby stools indicates its use in a social setting.\"\n- \"Inconclusive evidence for its exact function due to limited context.\"",
