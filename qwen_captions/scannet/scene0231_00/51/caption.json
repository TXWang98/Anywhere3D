    "caption": "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with a mix of green and blue hues. The tapered rim suggests it's designed for holding flowers or decorative plants. It has a slender neck and a wider base, giving it an elegant silhouette. While resembling a vase, the presence of what appears to be floral arrangements inside supports its use as a decorative container. Situated on a kitchen countertop near a window, surrounded by papers and other household items.",
