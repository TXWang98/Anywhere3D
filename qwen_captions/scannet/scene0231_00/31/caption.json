    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a light gray color and a cylindrical shape. The tapered rim suggests it might be a cup or small bucket. Its smooth surface lacks distinct structural features. Inconclusive evidence for its function, but it could be used for storage or as a disposable item. Found on the floor near a stack of books and other household items in a dimly lit room.",
