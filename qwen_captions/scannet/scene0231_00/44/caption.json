    "caption": "\"A possibly metallic tool-type object, matte silver with angular grooves. Ambiguous function between wrench or specialized clamp. Seen in workshop environment near assembly parts.\" \n\nIn this case, the green bounding box appears to enclose a section of the ceiling and wall rather than a distinct object. The analysis provided above is based on the assumption that there might be an object within the bounding box, but the images do not clearly show any specific item. Therefore, the caption reflects low confidence due to inconclusive evidence for identifying a tangible object.",
