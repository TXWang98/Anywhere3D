    "caption": "A possibly plastic container-type object with a white and blue color scheme. The shape is cylindrical with a slightly tapered rim, suggesting it could be a cup or small container. It appears to have a smooth texture. Its function is inconclusive but may be used for storing small items or as a disposable cup. Found on a cluttered desk alongside books, papers, and other miscellaneous objects in a dormitory setting.",
